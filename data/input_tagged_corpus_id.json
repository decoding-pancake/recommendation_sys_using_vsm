This data set is the first of its kind. We estimate household demands for the collection of garbage and recyclable material, the effect on the density of household garbage, and the amount of illegal dumping conducted by housholds. We also employ a basic probit model to estimate the probability that a household chooses each of several methods available to reduce their garbage. In response to the implementation of this volume-based pricing program, we find that households (1) reduced the weight of their garbage by 14.0%, (2) reduced the volume of garbage by 37.0% and (3) increased the weight of their recyclable materials by 15.7%. We estimate that additional illegal -- or at least suspicious -- disposal accounts for 0.486 pounds per week per person in Charlottesville, or 32% of the total reduction in garbage observed at the curb",

        "description": "Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the creation of low-order models to represent the behavior of linear interconnect circuits. Through approaches such as asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) and Pade' approximation, it is possible to efficiently compute a simple macromodel of a complicated interconnect. This macromodel can be combined with nonlinear driver and receiver models to accelerate the analysis of the circuit's responses. One problem with Pade' approximation is that it may generate unstable results. These instabilities arise because the macromodel actually represents an active, energy-producing network. It would be better for an interconnect model to be totally passive, never generating energy on its own. In this talk, we discuss the instability problem by appealing to certain classical techniques of passive circuit synthesis. It is shown that AWE is mathematically equivalent to the development of a ladder circuit that realizes the Pade' approximation in virtual hardware. For certain classes of circuits and certain pairs of input/output responses, the ladder realization consists entirely of positive-valued circuit elements; as a consequence, it is guaranteed to be passive and stable",

Since Val will be visible from the type of the interpreter (e.g., Prg  x  Val  ->  Val  for a simple one) programs derived from the interpreter by using, i.e., partial evaluation will  inherit  the universal  type  and perform repeated projections and injections. That is certainly not what we want. However, a study of a typical derived program shows  that  it  is not  possible  to improve much without further information. This is where the context of the program comes in. A  context  here is  a  description  of  the  input  --  in  the form of a grammer defining a subset of all possible Val values  --  and  a  similar description of the output. In  words,  the  context makes certain promises about the form of the input and the output. In the case of residual programs  from partial evaluation it is trivial to create good contexts",

The fastest known algorithms run in $O(min(mn,n^{2.38})$ time, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the graph. It is often the case that the aim is to compute the size of the transitive closure and the number of nodes reachable from certain nodes rather than computing them explicitly. Examples of potential applications are database query optimization or optimizing multiplications of large real-valued matrices. We present an $O(m)$ time randomized algorithm that estimates the number of nodes reachable from every node and the size of the transitive closure. Another ramification of our estimation scheme is a $\tilde{O}(m)$ time algorithm for estimating sizes of neighborhoods in directed graphs with nonnegative weights. Our size-estimation algorithms are much faster than performing the respective explicit computations and improve significantly over previous estimation methods",

In  such  environments, it is desirable to design protocols that  are  wait-free:  any  process that continues to run will complete its work in a fixed number of steps, regardless of delays or failures by other processes. In the past  few  years,  considerable  progress  has  been  made understanding   wait-free   protocols   for   systems   in  which asynchronous processes communicate by reading and writing  shared variables. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about such protocols in systems in which processes communicate with  certain more powerful synchronization primitives such as test-and-set, or fetch-and-add.

        "description": "Future parallel computers must execute efficiently both hand-coded applications and also programs written in high-level programming languages. Today's machines limit programs to a single communication paradigm---message-passing or shared-memory---which results in uneven performance. To address this problem, we have developed the Tempest interface, which supports shared-memory, message-passing, and hybrid applications. Tempest enhances portability of parallel programs by allowing low-cost networks of workstations to provide the same abstractions (e.g., shared memory) as high-performance parallel machines. The Tempest interface consists of low-level communication and memory-system mechanisms. Policies, such as shared memory, are implemented in user-level software, which allows programmers and compilers to customize policies to an application's semantics and sharing patterns. Experiments show that custom cache coherency policies can produce upto an order-of-magnitude performance improvement. We have completed two implementations of the Tempest interface. Typhoon illustrates the performance of first-class hardware support for Tempest. This proposed hardware system implements Tempest using a fully-programmable, user-level processor in the network interface</sentence>. <sentence>Blizzard demonstrates Tempest's portability by implementing the interface in software running on stock hardware (a Thinking Machines CM-5).

        "description": "A statistical language model assigns a probability to every sequence of words such that common sequences in the language (I have a headache) have high probability and uncommon ones (Headache a have I) have low. Such models are of most obvious use in speech recognition, but they have many other uses as well. The current gold standard in statistical language models is the trigram model, which estimates the probability of each successive word using statistics gathered on the probability of the word given the last two words. This is very dumb, but remarkably successful. We hope to create better models using more standard NLU techniques. We hope to model the language by first parsing the sentence, then collecting statistics based upon the parse (not just the last few words). In this talk we concentrate on the first of these steps and look in particular at probabilistic context-free grammar learning. Our scheme starts with a restricted form of context-free grammar such that only a finite number of rules apply to any given sentence. Starting with these rules, we then remove excess rules using the inside-outside algorithm.We concentrate on two interesting modifications of this scheme,n. The first we create several different grammars for the language using different subsets of our training data and then merge them.Interestingly, this significantly improves the quality of the learned grammar. In the second we learn a ``pseudo-context-sensitive'' grammar by collecting extra statistics on rule application (pseudo because the resulting formalism could be put back into context-free form by multiplying out the non-terminals of the language). This too leads to significant improvements",

However, discovering these search strategies is a knowledge-intensive time-consuming process which requires a deep understanding of the domain. The goal of this work is to develop techniques to allow for automated learning of effective domain-specific schedulers from a general scheduler with a flexible control strategy. In this approach, techniques from machine learning and statistics are used to automaticaly find control settings to for the scheduler which allow it to improve performance on the domain-specific problems of interest. These techniques have been applied to learning control settings for a scheduler to schedule operations for the 26-meter subnet of the Deep Space Network (DSN), operated by JPL and used to communicate with orbiting spacecraft and satellites. For DSN projected schedules, the machine learning techniques were able to decrease the amount of CPU time required to produce a schedule by 50% for problems solvable by the scheduler. In addition, the machine learning allowed the scheduler to solve 15% more of the problems within computational resource limitations.

Simulation  of  steady  state processes are  well  served  by packages  such as  PROCESS,  FLOWTRAN, CHEMSHARE, and  ASPEN. In addition, several  companies have in-house simulation  tools  catering  to   their  specific/proprietary   needs. However,   while computer   simulation   models   have   grown   in sophistication,  certain   capabilities  important  to   research  and development  planning,  systems  design  and  economic  analyses still remain in the stages of infancy.

The handbook is intended to help (a) redesign existing organizational processes, (b) invent new organizational processes that take advantage of information technology, and perhaps (c) automatically generate software to support organizational processes.  A key element of the work is a novel approach to representing processes at various levels of abstraction.  This approach uses ideas from computer science about inheritance and from coordination theory about managing dependencies.  Its primary advantage is that it allows users to explicitly represent the similarities (and differences) among related processes and to easily find or generate sensible alternatives for how a given process could be performed",

        "description": "In this presentation, I'll be describing a series of studies of communication patterns among people who are working together to produce complex intellectual products (e.g., scientific research articles) over long periods of time.  The studies focus on media choice and media effects, and on task distinctions that determine these outcomes.  They include both retrospective interviews about naturally occurring interactions and experiments in which we manipulated access to communications media in order to assess the effects of these variations on project outcomes such as time to completion and coordination difficulty. These investigations indicate that communication requirements are quite variable over the lifespan of projects, but that, across projects, one can observe regularities that have important implications for the design of technologies to support collaborative work. In particular, these studies reveal needs for different kinds of flexibility at different points in the project life cycle.  During the early stages of of work on open-ended projects and problems, equivocality is high, and achieving a shared sense of direction seems to require the flexibility in modes of expression that real-time face-to-face communication permits.  In later stages of project work, however, people often use a relay model of work on collaborative projects.  Thus, the interactivity and expressiveness that characterize face-to-face communication become less important; instead, people require tools that permit flexibility in social roles within the collaborative relationship.  The talk will conclude with a discussion of new research projects that attempt to go beyond either/or models of media effects by examining communication patterns within naturally occurring, media-rich environments",

        "description": "In this talk I will describe recent work aimed at developing more natural, inobtrusive, and robust user interfaces, by including *all* the modalities of human communication in the interpretation of human intent.  While multi-media information (images, text, sound) is now becoming available on the output side of most workstations and PC's, input is still mostly limited to keyboard and mouse.  Attempts at the use of alternate modalities have mostly focused on single input modalities and have so far found limited acceptance.  In an effort to improve this situation, we have recently begun to develop ways to process a multiplicity of signals that are believed to all carry meaning in human communication.  These include: Speech Understanding, Character Recognition, Lipreading, Eye-tracking, Gesture Recognition.  I will describe the signals and the methods we have developed to process them. I will then look at ways in which these can be combined to derive *joint* interpretations from multi-modal events.  Some modalities occur synchronously and can (should?) be combined at the signal or recognition level (e.g., lipreading and speech recognition), others are asynchronous (e.g., gesture and speech) and have to be combined at a semantic or pragmatic level.  I will discuss our preliminary results in combining lipreading with speech recognition, and gesture with speech recognition. In both cases the results suggest that more robust and natural interaction can be achieved by combination of modalities.  I will conclude by outlining our strategy to extend these preliminary results to practical user interfaces, such as editors and calendars",

        "description": "Although modelling in HCI research has tended to focus upon the user, he or she is not the only entity of relevance to interface design.  Usability is a function not just of the user, but of the joint user-computer interactive system.  Thus it is not sensible to consider user modelling in isolation from the rest of interface design.  Furthermore, unless a way is found for user modelling techniques to be integrated with the rest of the design process, they are unlikely to be applied.  It is not credible that busy interface designers will take 'time off' from design proper to 'do some user modelling'.  In recognition of these considerations, a collaborative multi-disciplinary project called Amodeus is aimed at understanding how different kinds of modelling (of the user, of the computer system, and of design) can be brought together to support the design of usable interfaces.  The project draws on two Psychological approaches to user modelling, an approach from Computer Science for applying formal methods to interface design and a complementary approach from Software Engineering for refining formal specifications into software architectures, a technique for representing the design rationale of an interface, and a cross-disciplinary approach to the interaction in its own right.  To illustrate how a multi-disciplinary analysis might proceed, the talk will discuss a specific technical problem that arises during interface design, namely the specification of the Undo facility for a collaborative text-editor.  The end result of the analysis is an understanding, from multiple perspectives, of the design options, of their consequences and trade-offs, of their impact on usability, and of other facters influencing the appropriate choices for the design",

        "description": "Multi-modal systems allow users to both tailor their input style to the task at hand and to use input strategies that combine several modes in a single transaction.  As yet no consistent body of knowledge is available for predicting user behavior in multi-modal environments or to guide the design of multi-modal systems.  This is particularly true when interfaces incorporate new technologies such as speech recognition.  For activities in a workstation environment, formal comparisons of speech with other input modes have failed to demonstrate a clear advantage for speech on conventional aggregate measures of performance such as time-to-completion, despite a consistent advantage displayed by speech at the level of single input operations.  The difference can actually be attributed to the additional incurred costs of non-real-time recognition and error correction.   While real-time performance can be achieved, it is unlikely that error-free recognition will be available in the near future.  Given these shortcomings, we might ask if speech can provide advantages to the user along dimensions other than task speed, for example by reducing the effort needed to generate an input.  The talk will describe some recent experiments that assess user behavior in a multi-modal environment in which actions can be performed with equivalent effect in speech, keyboard or scroller modes.  Results indicate that users freely choose speech over other modalities, even when it is less efficient in objective terms, such as time-to-completion or input error",

Unfortunately, the available evidence shows that many companies do not use even basic usability engineering techniques, partly because they are discouraged by the perceived complexity of those methods.  The 'discount usability engineering' method is intended for people who want to get most of the benefits from usability engineering without the expense and complexity of the methods needed to achieve perfect results. It consists of scenarios, simplified thinking aloud, and heuristic evaluation. Our findings indicate that even cheap thinking aloud studies can find a large proportion of the usability problems in an interface and that heuristic evaluation can also find many usability problems when a small number of evaluations are aggregated",

An  approach  to  automatically evaluating  the  quality  of  user  interfaces  to  interactive graphics applications will be the topic of  this  presentation. This  approach  is  based  on  the technology of User Interface Management Systems (UIMS).  One of the properties of a UIMS  is that  the  description  of  the interactive dialog is separated from the application code.  Because this description  has  been factored  out  of  the  code,  it  is  possible to analyze this description to answer  qualitative  questions  about  the  user interface.    In  particular  it  is  possible  for the UIMS to monitor  all  user  activity  and  map  such  activity  to  the particular   components  of  the  interface  description  which control this activity.  User interface  problems  can  then  be automatically  identified  in  a  way which focuses the work of human factors experts on the most cricital problems first",

This paper proposes a flexible, quantitative methodology for setting evaluation criteria which can be used to determine how well engineering institutions prepare their graduates for the working world. Survey, decision-analytic and concordancee analytic techniques are combined to develop a set of ~politically optimal,~ weighted educational outcomes, indicating a specified industry~s needs regarding the qualifications of their entry-level engineers.  The proposed methodology is illustrated through the development of educational evaluation criteria based on the needs of the international construction industry.",

The CIL has leveled itself at improving this astonishing oversight in scientific priorities, and  now contemplates a variety of projects which may give a more principled  basis for program design.  But there has never been any shortage of ideas on how to educate; the crucial shortfall lies in cleanly designed  experiments that distinguish clearly defined hypotheses.

Ruth Chabay and I have attacked these problems by developing a new course and a new textbook (recently published by Wiley) in which we emphasize qualitative reasoning as strongly as quantitative reasoning, thereby providing a conceptual framework within which the quantitative manipulations make more sense.  The course places heavy emphasis on atomic-level description and analysis, with detailed attention to the atomic structure of matter and its electric and magnetic interactions, with special emphasis on polarization phenomena in metals, insulators, and ionic solutions.  Each student has an inexpensive experiment kit which lets them perform crucial experiments during lecture, recitation, or at home, and which permits tight integration of theory and (just-in-time) experiments.  Electrostatics and circuits are usually portrayed as completely separate sciences, but we unify them by analyzing circuits directly in terms of the fundamental Coulomb interaction",

Among the trends and hopeful signs is this one: increasing numbers of statistics teachers use hands-on activities to generate data and teach statistical ideas. In the second part my talk I shall describe three sets of activities that I developed last year in an elementary linear models course. All three use inexpensive, everyday equipment, are quick and simple to set up, and can be adapted for use in teaching over a range of educational levels, from kindergarten to graduate statistics courses",

I compare and contrast spoken and signed language acquisition, as signed languages have evolved in the absence of sound and utilize different neural substrates from those involved in the perception and production of speech In my talk, I will first summarize key findings that have resulted from over a decade of research in my laboratory concerning the maturational timing and structural content of very early language milestones I will then summarize the results of new studies using rare populations of children, including hearing children exposed to signed and spoken languages from birth and hearing children exposed exclusively to signed languages from birth with no systematic exposure to spoken languages whatsoever Based on surprising similarities in the timing and structural content of all children, be they acquiring spoken and/or signed languages, I will then advance a testable theory about the brain-based mechanisms and environmental factors that together make early human language acquisition possible I will argue for the existence of a pattern-recognition mechanism in newborns, specifically, a neural substrate, which is uniquely sensitive to specific distributional patterns in the input relevant to aspects of natural language temporal patterning I will further discuss how this mechanism crucially works in conjunction with general motor production and perceptual constraints in early language ontogeny I will also advance the hypothesis that sound or speech is not the critical input component in early language ontogeny; instead, the presence of specific patterns encoded within a given input modality is key I will suggest that the presence of particular patterns in the input (regardless of the modality), in addition to the brain-based sensitivity to perceive and attend to them, together permit very early language acquisition to begin",

        "description": "The central question studied in this Masters thesis is how to design high-level reusable components for developing synchronous groupware applications. A modern user interface requires the separation of applications into two components, namely application and graphical user interface. An effective architecture for synchronous, multiple-user groupware applications requires a separation of one more component from the application: the management of the session and shared data. This component provides a framework that manages the  collaborative user session, shared data in an abstraction form, and floor control. This thesis terms this separation coordination independence. This thesis demonstrates a feasibility of the architecture by describing an experimental system, called TALISMAN, using Garnet. TALISMAN is implemented as a single-process, centralized system with multiple remote graphical displays. The system which features this separation relies upon object inheritance and the constraint satisfaction mechanism in the underlying object system. The architecture also makes the conversion of a single-user application into a multiple-user application relatively easy. The oral report will include a video demonstration of sample applications",

        "description": "Recently, there has been a surge of interests in the area of high-speed networks. Information Superhighway promises to provide various digital services ranging from conventional telephone to interactive high-definition TV. Regional telephone companies and cable companies plan to invest billions of dollars to provide an infrastructure for high-speed networks. Multiplexing video with data, audio, voice, and text, for example, represents a disparity of data rates and qualities that poses new challenges when creating a technology that is faster, less expensive, and more flexible. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is the internationally standardized transport technique for such high-speed multimedia networks. ATM is a promising technique for implementing an integrated access and transport network that can easily be shared by end-users holding multimedia service calls. My presentation will primarily be on the current state of the ATM technology, products, and market. It will include a discussion on the emerging network architectures in Broadband/ATM networking and some of the early applications. Additionally, the presentation will focus on some of the key issues related to interworking between ATM and other technologies and the drivers behind ATM adoption/deployment",

        "description": "I present a series of studies (done in collaboration with George Loewenstein) into the effects of framing, or perspective taking, on decision processes. There is a curious anomaly in how much variety people prefer to consume. If people SIMULTANEOUSLY choose several items for the future they will typically choose more variety than if they make their choices SEQUENTIALLY. For example, if you go to the same restaurant for lunch every day, you may choose the same meal every time (this is sequential choice). On the other hand, if you had to reserve several lunches in advance, you will likely choose different dishes (simultaneous choice). Most intriguingly, people who PREDICT what they will want expect they will prefer less variety than do people who actually CHOOSE in advance. Here are three ways in which how one thinks of the identical consumption problem influences what one consumes. This effect is surprisingly robust in the face of a wide range of manipulations, many of which are described in my talk. I suggest that it is neither the separation in time between choice occasions, or the gap between choice and consumption that determines the degree of variety seeking, but whether several choices are framed as a series of single-item choices or as the choice of a set of items. I will discuss the implications of these findings in domains outside of consumer decision making",

        "description": "Students learn in a variety of ways:  by seeing and hearing, working alone and in groups, reasoning logically and intuitively, memorizing and visualizing and modeling. Teaching methods also vary:  some instructors lecture, others demonstrate or discuss, some focus on principles and others on applications; some emphasize memory and others understanding. How much students learn in a class depends on the match between their preferred learning styles and the insturctor's preferred teaching style. When there are serious mismatches, students do poorly and et discouraged, instructors get frustrated by low class performance and poor evaluations, and society may lose some potentially excellent professionals. Three questions are explored in this presentation</sentence>:  (1) Which aspects of learning style are particularly significant in higher education? (2) Which learning styles are preferred by most students and which are favored by the teaching styles of most professors?  (3 What can be done to reach students with a wider variety of learning styles than are now being reached with standard instructional methods?",

We present a sorted version of type theory; we extend the syntax and semantics of simple type theory by a higher order sort concept that includes term declarations. In our system the partial ordering on the base sorts induces a partial ordering on the higher types by covariance in the rangesort and the natural inclusion of base function sorts. We present a set of transformations for sorted (pre-) unification and prove the nondeterministic completeness of the algorithm induced by these transformations",

The technique---compressing pairs of tape symbols into single symbols over a larger alphabet---unfortunately does not extend to realistic programs. We prove for a realistic programming language that for any reasonable time bound f(n) [time-constructable] there is a constant a and a set L recognizable in time a * f(n) but not in time f(n). The key to the proof is a constant slowdown self-interpreter for a language of while programs that manipulate lists.",

In the first part of our talk we show how to build machine-oriented versions of logics using Maslov's inverse method. However a naive application of the inverse method results in inefficient proof search procedures. To make proof search more efficient one has to find strategies pruning the search space. To this end, in the second part of our talk, we show how to find such strategies for an abstract notion of deductive systems. Then we project abstract definitions to concrete logics, obtaining efficient strategies for them. We also show how one can obtain decision procedures for a class of logics using a combination of the strategies",
